## Project Idea

Most young grads have a lot of hunger to learn but without any direction, it undermines their effort and some even relatively lose their direction. An easy way to abridge this would be to have a platform or an open application that can bring the people from corporate as well as colleges together. This can be initiated for college students as early as first-year students. People can associate themselves with a mentor with whom they can discuss and plan for their career goal as well as aspirations of learning. Mentors can on other hand guide them around their career and can advise them about their career path to achieve what they are planning.

#### Our Approach

##### Smart Platform for Mentors

A one stop solution for mentors and mentees discovering each other helping mentors to get the right audience at the right time.

##### Roadmaps and Tracks

Well defined tracks and roadmaps to kill ambiguity among resources.

##### Events Library

Missed something? We got you covered with all of it one place.

##### One on One Mentoring

Mentees can connect to their mentors once they enter the ecosystem.
